A collection of useful functions I have created to speed up JavaScript development.

# range()

Returns an array in the range of low to high (defaults 1 to 10) step is optional
and allows output to increment by a set amount each time i.e. low = 2, high = 10, step = 2
would have an output of [2,4,6,8,10]

# Syntax

range(low)
range(low, high)
range(low, high, step)
